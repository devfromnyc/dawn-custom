# Dawn Custom

Welcome to the Open Source Github Repository for editing the Shopify Dawn theme!

This is purely a development store where developers can improve on their Shopify Skills and make something awesome!

## How To Contribute - Getting started

To contribute to this repository, you need to request access. Permissions are set via Shopify Theme Access. Once your github/Shopify account is authorized, Please read the issue and pull request templates located in the github folder.

### Shopify CLI

You can follow this [quick start guide for theme developers](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-cli#quick-start-guide-for-theme-developers) to get started.

To connect to this store, you'll need a personal access token.

### Continuous Integration

This development store store is made up of 1 production theme (master/main branch) and 1 staging theme (staging branch). Theme published/releases are managed via github instead of manually publishing via Shopify. In future versions, all aspects of theme development will be managed via Shopify CLI, rather than the current limited capacity.

The master branch has select branch protections on it. To merge a pull request, you must have one other developer review the code before it can be merged.

### Code Checks via Github Actions

This repository also leverages Shopify Cli Theme Check and Prettier to ensure theme files follow the Shopify recognized architecture and that the code looks pretty!
